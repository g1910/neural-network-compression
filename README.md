## Introduction

With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence using deeper neural networks (Deep Learning), it is necessary to devise techniques that can make these deep architectures feasible for resource constrained environments. As part of this project, we aim to explore various ways to perform neural network compression using several techniques, particularly reinforcement learning.
